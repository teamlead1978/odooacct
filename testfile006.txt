Value is an essential component of any business. The Scrum Master does
what is necessary to teach the group product team how to execute the Scrum
so that they can create a valuable, high-quality product. The success of the
Scrum is based on the Scrum Master’s ability to guide the team according to
the company’s ideals (Visual Paradigm, 2018). Although the Scrum Master is
not a supervisor, the Scrum Master acts as an advisor helping the team. The
Scrum Master goes about this by getting rid of interventions, safeguarding
the team from erroneous knowledge, and assisting the team in implementing
flexible expansion procedures.
The Scrum Master provides ample opportunities to organize the team agenda
and show the team the best way to apply Scrum. The Scrum Master is good at
helping the team stay focused and overcome hindrances that stop them from
being successful (Agile Alliance, 2017). Nevertheless, working with an illequipped Scrum Master has its drawbacks because issues can come about due
to unsuitable behavior within the job. This happens when trying to make an
upper manager into a Scrum Master, which one would think they’d naturally
do well in since it is about showing leadership. Another way the issue arises
is by casually asking an individual to be the Scrum Master when they have
little knowledge of the Agile development process.
