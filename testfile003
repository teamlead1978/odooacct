Preparing for Certification
Now that you have a brief understanding of the differences between Agile
and Scrum, let’s take a look at the PSM1 Certification Exam. The PSM1
Exam has a total of 80 questions, and you will only have 60-minutes to
complete the entire exam and answer the questions correctly. Therefore,
we’ve provided exercises at the end of each chapter to test your
understanding of the subject and provide you with the practice you need to be
prepared.
You can add an additional challenge to the exercises by setting a 45 second
timer to answer each question separately. This will prepare you for when you
take the real exam and make sure you work quickly enough when answering
questions. The minimum passing score for the exam is 85%, but this course is
not aiming to meet the minimum, although it’s still good, but to help you get
90-100% on the first try.
