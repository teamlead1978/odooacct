The incremental approach involves making a series of small changes to the
project to improve its functioning. Incrementals are regularly used in the
technology industry, especially when companies need to improve their
product line or include new features for appealing to customersâ€™ desired
preferences (Kurnia et al., 2018; Scrum Alliance, 2019). The incremental
process is work divided or sliced into pieces known as increments. For
example, a company could have software that requires some bug fixing,
building, user stories, and so forth. The increment stage takes this into
consideration, then starts building the software little by little until it is made.
Both these approaches connect within the Agile methodology. Iterative and
incremental software development enables an increase in features with each
cycle release and upgrade. The end result of the iteration is a fully working
product, which additional functionality can be added to in future increments.
Agile Scrum development, when implementing these two approaches, is
based on a short iterative cycle of 1-4 weeks. Furthermore, in this process,
the team can take the increments and make the changes to them one by one.
In other words, the Scrum methodology focuses on developing new, intricate
software, which can lead to good results, especially when the team is
provided with objectives rather than assignments. The Scrum Team is in
charge of how they intend to meet the objectives set forth. Scrum can also
define the timebox of the iterative process or the time within which working
software should be delivered. Any team can use this methodology to see
projects become simpler and more rapid than they were before.
