Summary
Rusty is an Indian. This is a story about an orphaned boy, from the Anglo-Indian descent, living in a European colony in Dehra (a place in Uttarakhand ) with his guardian Mr Harrison and the missionary's wife, who wants him to stay away from Indians and groom him as a pure Englishman. However, in this process, Harrison’s stringent behaviour purturbs Rusty’s flourishing teenage years. While walking home in the rain, he is offered help by Somi and Ranbir who go on to become his friends. Rusty is unhappy with his life at his guardian's house and longs for freedom.
