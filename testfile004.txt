Since the recent advancements in technology, Agile Development has
become the new framework for developing high quality software. What is the
reason you might ask? Well, Agile development is based on the idea that
when a project is managed by a disciplined group of people, working
together, the project is likely to be of high-quality.
Because of this methodology, technology companies such as IBM, Google,
Apple, and 3M have adopted the model into their software building process
(Barcelos & Silva, 2020; Kurnia et al., 2018). Not only does using the agile
process make it easier for tech companies to plan projects, but it also makes it
easier to build effective software and electronics according to the customerâ€™s
specifications.
As a professional engineer and developer, it is important for you to
understand the additive and iterative phases that you will experience while
using the agile development method. It is a continuous process of improving
the software and seeking the feedback of customers to reach the final point in
the software development process (Barcelos & Silva, 2020). Agile may seem
like a complicated process, but once you have an understanding of the
method, it will come as second nature.
In fact, some organizations avoid using the agile development process due to
issues that arise with management and organizational culture, employee work
relationship, adapting or changing from a process-centric development to
feature-drive, and suitable technologies due to availability (Barcelos & Silva,
2020). Thus, not everyone agrees with the method, but because of its
effectiveness in software development, many companies are adopting the
different methodologies surrounding agile which will be discussed later on.
